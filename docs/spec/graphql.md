# The GraphQL surface — dialect specification

Status: **normative**. This document specifies the GraphQL dialect Spock
derives, independent of what any given toolchain version has implemented.
The v0 runtime implements **Tier 1** (§7); higher tiers are the target.
`docs/spec/v0.md` §8.2 records the v0 protocol binding (mount, page
discipline, error envelope); §9 here records the executed migration from
the pre-dialect surface.

## 1. Mental model

**The schema is a pure function of the contract.** Nobody authors GraphQL
in Spock — not types, not resolvers, not naming. Tables become types,
references become relationships, constraints become error codes, and the
whole thing regenerates on every load. There is no tracking step, no
metadata file, no per-table configuration. This forces one property that
shapes everything below: **every derivation rule must be total** — defined
for all legal contracts, with collisions failing at startup, never at
request time.

**Two write layers, one root.** The auto-CRUD mutations specified here are
the *borrowed floor*: generic per-table writes for prototyping velocity.
The *deliberate surface* — named `fn` mutations carrying product meaning
(`publish`, `follow`, `claim_username`) — lands on the same `Mutation`
root when the language grows `fn` (the analogue of Hasura Actions
alongside Hasura's generated mutations). Auto-CRUD is the floor, not the
ceiling; nothing in this document is the reason Spock exists.

**Introspection is the contract's metadata.** The schema is
machine-readable by design — for GraphiQL, for codegen, for LLM agents.
Every generated mutation's description enumerates the derived-error codes
it can produce, so an agent can learn the failure surface without ever
triggering it.

**Governance arrives later and changes visibility, not shape.** v0 derives
one open schema (ungoverned tier, by decision). When `policy` lands, the
same derivation runs per role — fields, rows, and mutations a role cannot
touch simply do not appear in that role's schema (the moral equivalent of
Hasura's permission-filtered schemas). The dialect itself is unchanged by
governance; that is why it can be specified now.

## 2. Dialect commitment

Spock mirrors **Hasura's** GraphQL dialect. Rationale, recorded once: it
is the most widely known auto-CRUD dialect (humans and LLMs have seen more
Hasura-shaped schemas than any other), it is snake_case like Spock, and
the doctrine says to borrow convention for the borrowed layer rather than
invent a bespoke one.

The mirroring rule has three clauses:

1. **Mirror** wherever Hasura specifies a convention (names, arg shapes,
   input-type suffixes, response envelopes).
2. **Define totally** wherever Hasura defers to per-table configuration
   (relationship naming) — Spock has no configuration, so this spec picks
   the rule.
3. **Deviate only with a stated reason**, recorded in the register (§8).

## 3. Naming laws

- **Object type = table name, verbatim.** Table `user` is type `user`;
  `post_media` is type `post_media`. (No case transformation: this is
  Hasura's convention, and it makes type naming injective by construction —
  the language already guarantees unique table names.)
- **Derived input/support types** take Hasura's suffixes:
  `<table>_insert_input`, `<table>_set_input`, `<table>_pk_columns_input`,
  `<table>_mutation_response`, `<table>_bool_exp` (Tier 2),
  `<table>_order_by` (Tier 2).
- **Scalars** are lowercase, Hasura-style: `uuid`, `timestamp` (plus the
  GraphQL builtins `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Float`, `ID`).
- **Field names** are the contract's, verbatim.
- **Reserved table names** (collide with roots or scalars): `query`,
  `mutation`, `subscription`, `uuid`, `timestamp`. A table with one of
  these names — or whose derived support-type names collide with another
  table's — fails at startup.
- **Relationships** (clause-2 territory; Hasura leaves these to config):
  - *forward*: the reference field's own name, resolving to the referenced
    object (`post.author: user!`). Spock has no separate raw-FK scalar
    field — the key is reachable through the object (`author { id }`).
  - *reverse*: `<child>_by_<field>` on the referenced type, resolving to a
    collection (`user.post_by_author: [post!]!`). Total by construction:
    two references from one child to the same table stay distinct
    (`follow_by_follower`, `follow_by_target`). No pluralization —
    English inflection is not a total function.

## 4. Reads

For every table `t`:

| Field | Shape | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `Query.<t>` | `(limit: Int, offset: Int°, where°, order_by°): [t!]!` | the list; default page 50, ceiling 200 (§8 deviation D2) |
| `Query.<t>_by_pk` | one non-null arg per key field: `(id: uuid!)`, composite `(follower: uuid!, target: uuid!)` | one row; **miss — including a malformed `uuid`/`timestamp` key value — is `null`** |
| relationships | §3 | forward: object (nullable iff the field is optional); reverse: `[child!]!` with the same list args |

° = Tier 2 (§7). Until then, lists take `limit` only and order by key
ascending; with `order_by` the default ordering remains key-ascending.

## 5. Writes

For every table `t` (single-row tier; bulk in §7):

| Field | Shape | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `Mutation.insert_<t>_one` | `(object: <t>_insert_input!)` | `t!` |
| `Mutation.update_<t>_by_pk` | `(pk_columns: <t>_pk_columns_input!, _set: <t>_set_input!)` | `t!` |
| `Mutation.delete_<t>_by_pk` | key fields as inline non-null args | `t!` (the row as read before deletion) |

Input types:

- `<t>_insert_input` — every field, **all nullable** (Hasura convention).
  Required-ness is *not* encoded in the input type: it is enforced by the
  contract at runtime, so a missing required field produces the derived
  `<t>_<field>_required` error with its code in `extensions` — the error
  surface stays uniform instead of splitting between GraphQL validation
  and the contract. Defaults apply on omission; on insert, `null` is
  absence (spec v0 §5.1).
- `<t>_set_input` — every **non-key** field, all nullable, with update
  semantics: **absent = keep, explicit `null` = clear** (or the derived
  `required` error on a required field). Key fields never appear in
  `_set`: keys are immutable, the key is the row's identity.
- `<t>_pk_columns_input` — the key fields, non-null.

A table whose every field is a key field derives **no update mutation**:
nothing is settable, and GraphQL forbids empty input objects. Its
`_set_input` / `_pk_columns_input` names stay reserved (§3) regardless.
(Hasura behaves the same way: no updatable columns, no update mutation.)

Write semantics (mirroring spec v0 §7.2):

- a write that did not happen — missing row, malformed key value — is an
  **error** with `extensions.code = "not_found"`, and the by-pk mutations
  return non-null `t!` accordingly (§8 deviation D1: Hasura returns
  nullable);
- an argument bound to a variable the client did not provide is treated
  as **omitted**, per the GraphQL spec, even where a library coerces it to
  `null` (normative);
- top-level mutation fields execute serially; each write is its own
  transaction — an earlier field's committed write survives a later
  field's error;
- deletes check inbound `restrict` references (→ `<t>_restricted`);
  `cascade` and `set null` delegate to the engine (children deleted or
  their reference field nulled, respectively).

### 5.1 Functions — the deliberate surface

Declared `fn`s (spec v0 §7.4) land on the same `Mutation` root as the
derived CRUD — the Hasura-Actions analogue promised in §1. All fns are
Mutation fields in v0 (read-only fns on `Query` wait for a purity
marker):

- `Mutation.<fn>` — the fn's name, verbatim; one argument per declared
  parameter (the parameter's value type: a table ref binds the target
  key's scalar), nullable iff the parameter is optional. For fn arguments
  `null` means *absent* — there is no `_set` carve-out, so the
  unprovided-variable correction is unnecessary here by construction.
- The return type follows the declared arity: `-> t` is `t!` (a miss is
  an **error**, `not_found` — deviation D1 applies to fns too), `-> t?`
  is `t` (miss = `null`), `-> [t]` is `[t!]!` — **uncapped**: the author
  owns `LIMIT` (a companion to D2, not a deviation from Hasura — the
  page cap governs derived lists, not authored SQL).
- A **scalar return** maps to the builtin's GraphQL scalar under the
  same arity scheme: `-> int` is `Int!`, `-> timestamp?` is `timestamp`,
  `-> [text]` is `[String!]!`. The field is a leaf — no selection set.
- `record` shapes register as object types under the §3 naming laws
  (bare name only; records derive no support types).
- The field description carries the declared error codes (`! a | b`) —
  the failure surface, introspectable before any call. Codes the SQL can
  produce but the signature does not declare still surface truthfully at
  runtime, routed cross-table to the owning table's derived error.
- **Mutation-root names are claimed**: derived CRUD names and fn names
  live in one namespace, and exactly what is registered is claimed (a
  pure-key table claims no update). A fn named `insert_user_one` fails
  at startup, never at request time.

## 6. Errors

Errors render as GraphQL's own `errors[]` over HTTP 200. The mechanism
mirrors Hasura (machine data in `errors[].extensions`); the **vocabulary
is Spock's** — every contract-derived error carries:

```json
{ "extensions": { "code": "user_username_taken", "kind": "unique",
                  "table": "user", "fields": ["username"] } }
```

Where Hasura says `constraint-violation`, Spock says which constraint, on
which table, over which fields — the code was in the contract (and in the
mutation's description) before any request was made. Reserved
non-derived codes: `not_found`, `type_mismatch`, `unknown_field`,
`bad_request`, `internal`.

## 7. The conformance ladder

- **Tier 1 — single-row core** (the v0 target): everything in §3–§6.
  `_by_pk` / `_one` operations, relationships both directions, `limit`,
  derived errors in extensions. This is exactly the subset of Hasura that
  requires no filter language.
- **Tier 2 — filtered and bulk**: `where: <t>_bool_exp` (Hasura's grammar:
  per-field comparison expressions `_eq _neq _gt _gte _lt _lte _in _nin
  _is_null`, text `_like _ilike`, combinators `_and _or _not`),
  `order_by: [<t>_order_by!]` (`asc | desc`), `offset`, and the bulk
  mutations `insert_<t>(objects:)`, `update_<t>(where:, _set:)`,
  `delete_<t>(where:)` returning `<t>_mutation_response
  { affected_rows: Int!, returning: [t!]! }`. Blocked on one deliberate
  decision: the filter language (the same decision REST writes wait on —
  one design should serve both).
- **Tier 3 — conveniences**: `on_conflict` upsert (blocked on the
  language-level upsert semantics, v1-FEEDBACK L2 — the dialect must not
  back into semantics the language has not decided), `_inc` and update
  operators, aggregates (`<t>_aggregate`).
- **Out of scope** until the doctrine asks for them: subscriptions /
  streaming, Relay connections, `distinct_on`, multi-batch
  `update_<t>_many`.

## 8. Deviation register

Deviations from Hasura, each deliberate:

| # | Deviation | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | by-pk write-miss is an **error** (`not_found`), return types non-null (Hasura: nullable, `null` on miss) | a write that did not happen must shout; silent-null writes are a known footgun — Spock is a truth-telling prototype tool |
| D2 | lists carry a default page (50) and ceiling (200) (Hasura: unbounded by default) | protocol-level cap is doctrine (v1-FEEDBACK L6) |
| D3 | error codes are derived, specific, and pre-declared (Hasura: generic `constraint-violation`) | derived errors are the product |
| D4 | no configuration layer; relationship names are spec-fixed (§3) (Hasura: console/metadata tracking) | derivation must be total; a prototype language has no metadata step |
| D5 | no raw FK scalar sibling for reference fields (Hasura: `author_id` column + `author` relationship) | Spock's reference field *is* the semantic name; the key is one hop away |
| D6 | query depth bounded (32) (Hasura: unlimited unless configured) | self-references allow unbounded nesting; a prototype runtime ships safe |

## 9. Migration from the v0.0 surface (executed)

The first v0 runtime shipped a Tier-1-equivalent surface with pre-dialect
naming; it has since been renamed to this specification. The mapping is
recorded (breaking; pre-release):

| v0.0 (as-is) | Tier 1 (to-be) |
|---|---|
| type `User` (PascalCase + collision guards) | type `user` (verbatim; guards removed — injective by construction) |
| scalars `UUID`, `Timestamp` | `uuid`, `timestamp` |
| `Query.user_list(limit:)` | `Query.user(limit:)` |
| `Query.user(id:)` | `Query.user_by_pk(id:)` |
| reverse `post_author_list` | reverse `post_by_author` |
| `create_user(<inline args>)` | `insert_user_one(object: user_insert_input!)` |
| `update_user(id:, <inline args>)` | `update_user_by_pk(pk_columns: {id:}, _set: {…})` |
| `delete_user(id:)` | `delete_user_by_pk(id:)` |
| create's required fields = non-null args (validation-shadowed `required` error) | insert_input all-nullable; `required` is a runtime derived error again |
| reserved: `Mutation` via PascalCase check | reserved: `query`, `mutation`, `subscription`, `uuid`, `timestamp` |

Unchanged by migration: update's absent/null semantics, write-miss-shouts
(D1), the extensions payload, limit caps (D2), serial mutations, depth
bound, GraphiQL on GET, introspection on.
